# Random tidbits of cooking knowledge


## Leidenfrost effect

- If eggs are sticking to the pan, it means the pan ain't hot enough.
  - If your pan is hot enough and then you add oil, that's the best (without burning the oil)
  - If you start with a cold pan and try to make it hot, your food can and will stick
- The effect is observed with a super hot surface and a liquid which is of lower boiling point temperature, the liquid will appear to be repelled by the surface.
- A film of steam develops between the liquid and the surface, preventing direct contact. It'll continue to repel until there isn't enough liquid left.
- With this, you could stick your hand into an extremely cold (or hot!) liquid and provided you yank it out quick enough, no damage.
