# Why I like food halls / cafeteria style places

To be precise, I like locations where:
- it's communal seating.
- one or more food vendors
- you bus your own food to the table
- focus is purely on the food, not on service


I like them (like the Mitsuwa one), with Misasa and Santouka.

I think it’s because I like to eat alone, but really don’t like the pressure of dining in.

Here, the kitchens make food, and you find your own place to consume it. It scales up nicely and you can have everyone pick whatever they want to eat and everyone can be happy. You can also hang out there and work on stuff if you desire.

No worrying about tipping since nobody is refilling water, you bus your own food. No nonsense. Clear expectations. Restaurants focus on food as they should be.
