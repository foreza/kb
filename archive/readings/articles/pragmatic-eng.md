### Summary:
- Blameless culture is the best approach, focus on long term learning over short term action items.
- Witch hunts are probably the least productive approach in the short and long term.
- Have a "point" person for all incidents, like an incident commander.
- The focus isn't to prevent all future outages as they will and can happen - it is to understand how to mitigate and better detect them. 
- Incident reviews are vital for the above point. (oops, avoid postmortem), what's the "aha!" moment. 
- interesting - some companies (deliberately!) do not tracking follow up action items. the goal of the review (post incident) is instead to find the knowledge gap and how the system was able to surprise them. most of the action items end up being things they were going to do, anyway.
- the "5 why's method" - could be a dangerous framework leading to an individual/group being blamed for an outage. 
- don't do an RCA/analysis for the sake of doing one - do it to uncover deeper issues within the infra/org. make it a systemic investigation
- incidents draw attention to them, which means they can be used to drive change!
- fixing things fast does not equate to learning. documentation of the incident and play by play is more important than we think. write them to be examined in the future, not for the "now"
- tech is WAY ahead in terms of incident handling - other industries could benefit from what tech already does (lots of data, lots of reporting, easy access to all) vs aviation or medical, where getting that data is hard.
