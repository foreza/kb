# Coffee Studies Menu

## Premise

This menu is a curated list of places which are suitable (I have vetted!) for a cup of brew and working/thinking.
Yelp and google are great for their own reasons, but I'd like something of my own.
This is not a tier list. I frankly don't care for that. 

The main features I look for are:
- Wifi (preferably secure)
- Bathroom (cleaner, the better)
- Reasonably quiet
- Has ample seating with table (preferably indoors)
- Decent coffee
- No pressure to buy anything

## Meh List

These shops aren't the best (in my book), but I'd be open to reconsidering them.
Note that this doesn't reflect on the quality of their coffee, but more "would I go here if I needed to study"

- Coffee Tomo (Irvine Blvd) // Always crowded when I go in there, not a lot of seating inside. 
- BLK Coffee, Irvine Spectrum // Scant outdoor seating, used to be my go-to.
