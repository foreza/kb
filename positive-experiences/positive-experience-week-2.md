## Positive Experience - Week 2

## 1 - The most generous of hot pots

To preface this, hosting a hot pot is a daunting task.
My SO's friend took the challenge of hosting to a brand new level.
Sauces of different types. Soup bases of different types.
Varying species of mushrooms. An assortment of fish balls.
Corn, veg, and meat as far as the eye could see.

It was a great evening. I ate until my stomach almost burst.
