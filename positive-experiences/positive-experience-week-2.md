## Positive Experience - Week 2

## 1 - The most generous of hot pots

To preface this, hosting a hot pot is a daunting task.
My SO's friend took the challenge of hosting to a brand new level.
Sauces of different types. Soup bases of different types.
Varying species of mushrooms. An assortment of fish balls.
Corn, veg, and meat as far as the eye could see.

It was a great evening. I ate until my stomach almost burst.


## 2 - New hire swag

OK, fine. This one has been done to death, so I'll keep it short.
Got a new (branded) mug. New pens. New backpack. Socks. Blanket.
All great. Put the mug to immediate use. Pens are used. 
Washing the socks and blanket first - I'll use that to keep my knees and feet warm.

Thanks, LR. Remote onboarding is difficult, eh?



## 3 - Seaside tunneling and the birth of a bird

Just a small thing / memory.
We went to the beach today and sat for a bit, reading and thinking.
My SO came up with a name for a poem/piece after observing a couple of tiny birds.
I was reading a book as well as digging a tunnel with my 2 feet in the sand.
Makes me wonder why we don't do that more often
