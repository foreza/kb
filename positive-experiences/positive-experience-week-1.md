## Positive Experience - Week 1

## 1 - The Jazz Man of Powell (9/14/21)

Yesterday, my SO and I gave some money to a street musician outside of Powell’s bookstore in downtown Portland.

This isn’t a big thing or some grand gesture, but still, a remarkable step for us both.

We had talked about this on the plane over to Portland about how we always felt guilty not having some cash on hand for good street performers. 

Or if we did, not having a good enough denomination of bills to give them.

And even if we did, just not having the courage to walk up and deposit that bill.

To preface this, neither of us are super well-off, but we can spare a couple bucks here and there. 

We agreed that if we found a musician that played "well", and had some cash, say 1-5$.. We’d just give it to them. No questions asked.

"Well" is a bit subjective, but we usually agree on what constitutes "well".

We heard this guy wailing away on his sax almost a block away. 

Initially, we weren’t too impressed (well, I was quite impressed actually) but we continued to listen as we drew nearer. She perked up.

“Do you have any cash?”
“Yeah. I got a ... let’s see. A 20?”
“That's too much. Anything smaller?”
“Mm.. got a 10... oh, here’s a 5”

I pressed the bill into my SO’s hand.

"Go, give it to him. But make sure he’s not just practicing." I said.

As soon as the bill hit the interior of the case, the man gave us a nod of gratitude... and his music took on a whole new dimension.

Prior, he was playing a small little tune.. now we got a crazy bombardment of trills and overtones that seemed to be screaming, “thanks, my dudes”

It was so small and insignificant. 
But at that moment, I think we did the right thing.
