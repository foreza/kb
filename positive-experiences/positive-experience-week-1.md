## Positive Experience - Week 1

## 1 - The Jazz Man of Powell (9/14/21)

Yesterday, my SO and I gave some money to a street musician outside of Powell’s bookstore in downtown Portland.

This isn’t a big thing or some grand gesture, but still, a remarkable step for us both.

We had talked about this on the plane over to Portland about how we always felt guilty not having some cash on hand for good street performers. 

Or if we did, not having a good enough denomination of bills to give them.

And even if we did, just not having the courage to walk up and deposit that bill.

To preface this, neither of us are super well-off, but we can spare a couple bucks here and there. 

We agreed that if we found a musician that played "well", and had some cash, say 1-5$.. We’d just give it to them. No questions asked.

"Well" is a bit subjective, but we usually agree on what constitutes "well".

We heard this guy wailing away on his sax almost a block away. 

Initially, we weren’t too impressed (well, I was quite impressed actually) but we continued to listen as we drew nearer. She perked up.

“Do you have any cash?”
“Yeah. I got a ... let’s see. A 20?”
“That's too much. Anything smaller?”
“Mm.. got a 10... oh, here’s a 5”

I pressed the bill into my SO’s hand.

"Go, give it to him. But make sure he’s not just practicing." I said.

As soon as the bill hit the interior of the case, the man gave us a nod of gratitude... and his music took on a whole new dimension.

Prior, he was playing a small little tune.. now we got a crazy bombardment of trills and overtones that seemed to be screaming, “thanks, my dudes”

It was so small and insignificant. 
But at that moment, I think we did the right thing.

## 2 - A happy accident leading to a Louisiana Trip

I'll preface this by saying that this wasn't an actual trip to louisiana.
But my taste buds don't know the difference.

We had this challenge of trying to eat all the different restaurants in our area.
We were down to just a handful - one of them was a thai place near us, as well as a recently opened new orleans style restaurant. 

After some deliberation, we went first to the thai place. 
Inside the restaurant, plenty of folks and essentially a full house on a Thursday night.
No room indoors, so the waiter told us to go around to their patio and order using our phones.
Sky high menu prices as well as being seated outdoors (with nobody else around) led to a hasty retreat. 


We instead opted for the other restaurant, which was only a couple minutes away.

Besides another table of 2, it was just us.
I wanted the gumbo - but the waiter told us that they were out! (OH NO)

I ended up getting the fish dinner with a side of mac and cheese.
My SO opted for a shrimp po'boy (essentially, a sandwich).

It was wonderful. The food took a bit of time for sure, but it was to be expected.
Cleaned my plate and destroyed the sandwich. 

Would go back. 

This reads like a yelp review.
