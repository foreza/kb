### Summary:
- In this world today, the bar is perceived to be super high for creators.
- There is still value (for you) in getting something to work.
- It's hard to impress others given the tech that is readily available.
- One pixel / one unit of data can bring you joy. 
- The context of something is extremely important. 
  - Full HD experience of something that bores you is still bad.
  - Pixelated faces of a game that you are immersed in is great.
- Powerful new tech, if used correctly, is still very valuable! But still second priority to the experience itself. 
- The experience of "hello world" comes from the satisfaction of learning and creating

### My thoughts:
- It becomes easier once I've cleared the hurdle of "hello world" for a given language. It also gets more scary, but in a good way. It's no longer "I don't know what's going on", it is "I have so much to learn" which is good!
- The bar is certainly way higher. I was not easily impressed back then as a kid since tech was "normal" to me.
- As a technical person, I want to continue having the "hello world" experience for a long as I live.
- I believe this justifies my reasoning for continuing to use my GTX 670 - I don't play super crazy games, and games like Stardew Valley and Gameboy emulators are good enough for me. :)
