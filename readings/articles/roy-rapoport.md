Started reading this as I combed through my inbox this AM.
Takeaways:

- You're paid to be right, but outright challenging others over it is going to make you a very unpopular person. (a heretic)
- You CAN be deeply opinionated and things CAN change, but change isn't going to happen in a day
- You can be right eventually, and it will feel great in the moment to be right. But you need to be more persuasive. 
- Being right doesn't mean jack if you can't persuade people you are right, and get them to come to your line of thinking.
- Leadership is setting a north star, and getting everyone to move towards it. Key word is move - not GO there right away.

  - This really puts a nice realistic image of "what it means to be a leader" in my head. Not everyone is going to perfectly "get it", but as long as you can course correct them even a tad bit, you're doing good.
