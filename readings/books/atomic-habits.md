# Reading on Atomic Habits 


## Progress:

9/5/21: I kicked off the whole "kb" idea to keep myself honest. A little change every day to get myself working. Initial commit. 
9/6/21: Oh man, that habit is HARD to get started. Also, guess who forgot to charge their kindle? Anyway, I volunteer an unnecessary thought: zen mode in VS code was invented for this exact purpose.
9/7/21: Wow, I went real deep. I'm going to pull back on the amount of personal commentary and go faster for today so I'm ready for the first bookclub session tonight.
9/16/21: I went on a trip and came back on the 15th. I read the whole time, but didn't document anything here. 
9/17/21: Removed the whole "discussion" points thing. I feel like it was getting out of hand. Fixed formatting and added all the placeholder chapters for where I need to be.
9/19/21: Been working at this steadily and documenting my highlighted parts. 


## The Fundamentals

### Chapter 1 Notes:

#### Habits also compound, like interest. 
1% improvement every day will compound (cycling team example, improving in unexpected areas).
Not all improvements are noticeable right away. Small improvements have an additive effect. 
Improving bit by bit will be noticeable over a longer period of time. 
It may take a long time before you recognize/realize the impact of your actions.

Example: 
Being generally frugal will not help day to day, or right away.
But over time, you will have saved more than a millionare who spends much more per day.

Our bad (small) choices will compound into toxic results if left unchecked - catch ourselves from repeating 1% errors
Impact of setting/changing habits can lead to very drastic changes.

#### Success is the byproduct of daily habits. 
Be more concerned with your trajectory than the results.
Think about the "lagging measure". You are what you repeat (eat!).
Goals don't matter as much as the way you get there.
Habits are double edged sword - make them work for you.


#### Positive compounding
- one extra task a day = a lot done over a year!
- getting more knowledge a day, learning small things... commitment to lifelong learning.
- relationships compound. being excellent (consistently) to others results in them investing in you

#### Negative compounding
- stress compounding. Add high blood pressure, job stress, parenting = health issues!
- negative thoughts also compound. If you think your peers are stupid, everyone will be stupid eventually to you.
- riots/protests are not created in a day, but rather just a byproduct of microaggressions and and aggravations.

#### Breakthrough Moments
Ice cube melting analogy for describing progress.
Room is getting warmer, ice cube stays as is until 32 degrees. 
This is an example of a "breakthrough" moment. 

Other examples of "breakthrough" 
cancer (spends 80% of life seemingly undetectable)
bamboo (doesn't sprout for a long long time but will then shoot up overnight)
earthquakes (2 tectonic plates grinding for a looong time)


#### To get to a breakthrough, you must cross the "valley of disappointment".
This is why most efforts to set habits fail - no easy return in investment, person gives up.

You need to persist long enough to break through this plateau. (plateau of latent potential)

#### You don't necessarily waste work, it was being stored for later.
^ I can actually resonate with this one. I spent the first few months of my new job literally contributing nothing.
I was supposed to help out on issues, but couldn't do much since I knew nothing of the industry or the product.
I made bad decisions, had fairly little output, and was constantly kicking myself for not being better.
And yet 6 months later, I was able to begin contributing in a more useful fashion. 
What did help was that it was a job, not some hobby - I didn't really have an option beyond a) quitting and finding another job or b) sticking through with it and doing what I could.

Takeaway quote summarized in my own words:

When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering at a rock.
No visible damage shows as they hammer away. But at the 100 or 101 hit, the rock finally cracks breaks.
Did the stonecutter hit harder than before? No. It was the combined efforts of the hits before it that weakened it enough. 


You need to be patient. 


#### Breaking a bad habit is tough, building a good habit is like caring for a delicate flower daily. Focus on systems.
Specific actionable goals are fine, but it's the journey that really matters.
Goal - specific goal to achieve.
System - the method of achieving the goal. 

Examples:
Football Coach's goal is to win. System is to recruit the best players that follow a specific standard, hold daily practices, get good assistants and analysts.
Startup CEO's goal is to get brought out. System is to network extensively and every day, tackle features to increase valuation, hire developers who are familiar with scalable systems.
Musician's goal is to play new piece. System might be to practice every day for an hour, see an instructor, replay difficult measures, try different tempos.

#### You could succeed in your goal if all you focused on was your system.

Relevant example to me  - my initial goal was to do the very best I could do in the partnership with a specific partner.
The relationship had soured by the time I joined, so I set a lofty goal of being recognized by this partner as an outstanding individual that might even get hired by them one day.
My system needs lots of tweaking, but I focused only on it and literally forgot about the goal.
I was always candid with the partner, went up to bat for them constantly, and fought internally to get more visibility on their projects.
I took extra time out of my day to speak with the partner's devs, made them feel comfortable, and addressed concerns as soon as they came up.
I also took on additional responsability and rose to be a SME and even an engineer on the platform, rather than just the technical solutions guy passing the message or buck.
I got there, alright. I didn't even know I had gotten there till my last few days with the company.
I had been completely ingrained in my own process.

If I had only focused on being recognized by this partner, I might have instead done other things that may have come across as a play for attention, or not being productive.
I might have gotten impatient earlier on and just asked earlier on to be transitioned off the project.
But since my system was to always be consistent, do my best, and be inquisitive - it paid off.

#### Winners have the same goals as losers

Wow, this hurt. But it's true. If there is a gold medal and 5 people competing ... somebody is going to lose, no doubt about it.
If we focus on the goal alone, we're going to be in for a bad time.
But these 5 people are also at the absolute top of their sport and they didn't get to where they were by simply dreaming - they had to train. Relentlessly.

Also - survivorship bias is a thing. We celebrate the ones who made it, but don't talk about the ones who trained as hard, worked as hard, but didn't make it. 

I want to also chip in a bit here - I'm not somebody you'd consider a "winner". 
I also most certainly didn't work as hard as many of my peers to get to where I am.
I'm doing OK for myself - but all of this is luck, and a bit of hard work where it counted.
I have friends who most certainly are struggling to make ends meet.
This makes me realize that it's important to call out people's efforts and not just celebrate winners.
Not all winners are created equally, and not all goals are attained equally.

Kind of a pessimistic view? I feel that people can work hard and be appreciated for hard work - and become disillusioned that their hard work didn't pay off. 

As an actionable item, I want to pay it forward as much as I can and call out good, hard work when I see it being done. And hype that person up as much as possible. That's the LEAST I can do...

#### Achieving the goal is momentary.

Messy room cleaned? Great! It'll get messy again by next week.
But if you are constantly cleaning as you go...
Don't treat the symptom. Root out the core root cause. 
Fix the input of the function and the output might be better / you don't have to do as much work. 

#### Focusing just on goals will make you mostly miserable. Focus on the system.

OW this hurt hard. But this is also true.
If your goal is "attain a A+ at the end of the semester", boy it's going to suck.
But if you focused instead on studying well for 3 hours every day in the morning, taking notes, and getting a full 8 hours of sleep - you'll probably feel better if you could hit those smaller milestones.
And likely get the A as well since you're focusing not on the goal, but the process of getting to that goal.

I'm wrapping up for this session, but I want to workshop myself.
I want to finish this book, for instance.
Well, why don't I try just reading for an hour each day, and notetaking just like I do now?
It's not long, and it's not boring. I'm really into it, and this way generates lots of content.
And I can push my github commit streaks.
What's bad about that?


#### Yo-yo affect - after achieving the goal, what next?

After the runner finishes the marathon, they have 2 roads.
They can keep training anyway. Maybe it became a lifestyle.
Or... they just stop and fall out of peak condition.

What's left to do? What stops me from reverting?

I worked tirelessly to get a 6 pack. Yes, I succeeded.
And then I gained back all that weight soon after.
The goal was reached, but the lifestyle didn't stick.

Setting goals can help you win the game - but the habits allow you to keep playing the game.
I realize that now.

Even though I lost the 6 pack, I've found a bit of a happy medium where I still exercise, I don't overeat, and I watch my salt/sugar/carb intake. This process has kept the weight off.

#### If you can't change a bad habit, you have a bad system. You'll fall to the level of your system. 

You fall to the level of your systems - you don't stay at the level that you attained the goal. 

It's an interesting thought, this one. I feel it's a little bit you, too.
Ultimately, in the end, you have to take that first dive / enforce your own system.

Personal examples here - me being a bit overweight all through my earlier years, through high school and even college. 
As long as I can remember, I see-sawed between losing weight, and not giving an arse.

I was overall unhappy with the quality of life. Hard to date, hard to do anything physical, felt like a sweaty oaf all the time. 

I'd work out once in a blue moon, maybe go for a run. But nothing was consistent. 

I started working out properly back in 2016? and I don't think I went back since. I went with housemates and coworkers to the gym. We tried the same diets. The system in place was difficult and I remember completely taking u-turns on some days. The system itself was simple - eat a lot of protein, less carbs, alternate muscle groups and work out with a group constantly.

The missing item was the group mentality, in my opinion. Long after that group has disbanded - it gave me the strength and the knowledge to go to the gym myself, work on myself, and keep myself relatively fit. 

To me, I was lucky to have other people keeping me accountable as part of the system. It's fair to say that there is some truth to this statement - I had a bad system earlier on. Sporadic visits to the gym wouldn't cause anything in the long term. Calorie cutting for merely 3 days wouldn't cause anything long term. 

#### Habits are the atoms of your life - hence, "atomic habits".

To dissect this a bit - our lives are comprised of habits. 
Small things like doing the dishes as soon as we're done eating, sleeping at a specific time all form a part of your life.

This ties into the name of the book - atomic habits. Small little units that define you.




### Chapter 2 Notes

#### Easy to repeat bad habits and hard to form new ones

Once a habit is established, it sticks around. 
When we try to change a habit, we might do 2 things wrong
- we change the wrong thing
- we change it the wrong way

3 layers of behavior change:
- Outcomes: changing a result. Smoking? Stop smoking. Goals are set at this level.
- Process: changing a habit or process. Cleaning your desk before starting work. Habits are at this level.
- Identity: Changing beliefs. Your worldview, image, biases, assumptions.

All these layers of change are useful.

#### Focus on what you want to become rather than the outcome

We want to avoid outcome based habits. We want to build identity base habits.

Do I want to stop smoking, or do I want to stop being known as a smoker?
"I'm trying to quit" vs "I don't smoke".

Most people don't consider identity change when they try to change.
Behind every system of actions lies a system of beliefs.

You can't truly change if you are not that sort of person.
You can't change if your mind isn't really there and you don't identify as that.
You need to change who you are before you can truly establish the habit you want.

#### An old identity can sabotage your new plans for change

If you don't shift the way you look at yourself, you will not change.
Example - voting in a dictatorship isn't possible. (but in a democracy, it is)

Example of fingernail biting - once they realized the nails looked nice, the owner was proud and never bit their nails again.

#### When a habit becomes part of your identity, it is the ultimate form of intrinsic motivation

Instead of "I want this", I am a person who IS this.
If you pride yourself on something that you identify as, you will be motivated to maintain habits associated with the identity.

Example - I identify as a technical person and am proud of the fact that I can write code and make products. I'm motivated to keep my technical skills sharp, read documentation, try code challenges, and take on technical duties where possible at work. 

Other examples:
If you are proud of biceps, you'll always work on them and never skip an upper arm workout.
If you are proud of knitting, you'll put in the time to knit more each work.

#### Changing behavior is changing your identity. 

You may be motivated to start a habit, but your identity is what keeps the habit. 
All improvements would be temporary.

Examples:

Goal isn't to be at FAANG - the true goal is to be an engineer who these companies would pay an arm and a leg to bring onboard. 
Goal isn't to learn how to play the violin. The goal is to become a musician.
Goal isn't to learn how to cook a dish. The goal is to become a chef..?

[JC]: The other 2 goals are examples from the book - I'm not quite following, but I'll carry on.

You're more likely to act in alignment with what you believe in.

Doing the "right" thing is easy. So by acting like the type of person you wish to be, it's magnitudes easier to incorporate habits.


#### Identity change is also a double edge sword.

It can work for you or against you. 
If you identify as something, you could also impact your ability to change.

[JC] This answers (in part) my hesitations from earlier, but the question is still out there. If I identify as an engineer, is there a scale as to how MUCH I identify? How much is too much? Seems like it's up to the discretion of the user. How much do you wish to identify? Maybe just "enough" to create the habit? 

"I'm not a good people person" 
"I'm not a morning person at all"
"I'm always late"
"I'm not good with any sort of tech"
"I'm reaaal bad at math"

I can at least resonate with the last one a bit. 
I shied away from anything math since I didn't perform so well back then in high school, but math especially since I was told "You can't fail at math! It's literally the only thing asians are good at! (ow)

#### There is internal pressure to always maintain self image 

[JC] I am on board with this thought. I feel this all the time. 

You will always behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs.
The real reason why you'd fail to stick with a habit is that your self-image will get in the way. 


#### Good progress requires unlearning.

Becoming the best version of yourself requires unlearning.
Constant edits to your belief system. 
Upgrading and expanding your identity.

You want to constantly erase the pieces of your identity that hold you back while building new pieces that help move you forwards.

#### Your identity emerges out of your habits.

We're not born with preset beliefs.
You learn these beliefs, and then they are reinforced through experience.

Examples:
- making your bed every day: organized person.
- write each day: creative/thoughtful person.
- train each day: discipline, athletic person.

The more you repeat behavior, the more you reinforce that in your system.
If you went to church for 20 years, you are religious.
You study calculus for 2 hours a night, you are studious.
You drive up to your SO's house every weekend, you are a .. good SO?

The author became a writer through his habits. 
Practicing writing. Every day. 
New article every M/Th for many years.

[JC] I mean, I perceived him as an writer. So, it's clearly working for him.

Identity formed out of the "mounting evidence".
Identity forms through repetition.

#### Building habits is the process of building yourself - it's gradual.

You don't just magically become a new person.
It is done through hard work, repetition, and consistency.
We ideally should be constantly evolving slowly towards the better version of us.



#### Every action I take is a vote for the person I wish to be.

Change doesn't need to be crazy or radical. It can be small.
Think small, but meaningful steps in the right direction.

To change who you are is to change what you do.

- each line of good, concise, readable code I write makes me a engineer that I'd be proud to work with.
- each jira ticket I spend the time to write out makes me a better communicator.
- each time i open my IDE to add more to this book reading markdown makes me a better notetaker.
- each time I take the higher ground in the argument, I am seeking the greater good.

Works the opposite/bad way too. Every time I agree to take a puff of smoke, I'm voting for cancer (long term) Every time I drink excessively, I'm stumbling a bit closer towards becoming an alcoholic. 

#### The 2 step process...

##### 1. Decide the type of person you want to be.

What do you stand for?
What are your values?
What do you want to become?

Who is the type of person who would get the outcome I want?

Examples:
- I'm the kind of teacher who stands up for my students
- I'm the kind of lawyer who stands up for the underserved.
- I'm the kind of doctor who ensures each patient is given the time and support they need.


##### 2. Prove it to youself with small wins.

Would a healthy person eat a burrito, or a salad? 
Choosing the salad is a small win.

Would a healthy person work late into the night, or stop at a reasonable place?
Stopping at 6 PM rather than 10 PM is a win.
Rejecting the invite for a business call at 3 AM is a win as well.

Would a healthy person have anxiety and worry about their eyes?
No, they wouldn't. They'd continue doing whatever they were doing.


#### It's all feedback loops. 

Habits shape identity, identity shapes habits.
Results are a result of this loop.
Let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than the results.

Focus on always being that type of person, not the outcome.


### Chapter 3 notes

- behaviors followed by satisfying consequences are repeated.
- behaviors that produce not so satisfying consequences are not.
- habits are behaviors that have become automatic, simple solutions to our environment. mental shortcuts. 
- when first forming a habit, neurological brain activity is high
- feedback loop - try, fail, learn, try something else. trial and error.
- after a solution is found, brain automates the process. "if this, then that".
- the conscious mind is a bottleneck for the brain. (we typically might think of them one and the same)
  - conscious mind likes to pass tasks to the unconscious part of the mind.
  - habits are formed as a result of this
- habits LEAD to freedom. less decisions that need to be made is better. mind can focus on other things that you want to think about.
- habit has 4 steps in the loop: cue, craving, response, reward.
- cue triggers a craving, craving triggers a response, response gives reward.
- cue/craving = problem, response/reward = solution.
- our mind is always scanning for rewards internally and externally.
- we crave not the "thing", but the change in state. brain is a reward detector.
- every person processes "cues" differently. different people are motivated by different cues. 
- response to the craving happens depending on the amount of friction that needs to be overcome (by the behavior)
- all habits must have some sort of reward. cue -> reward.
- if any part of this feedback loop is missed, habits won't form. 
- we'll act without thinking in the case of a well formed habit.
- we all have decades of mental programming and rarely notice habits that run our lives. 
- making a habit is applying these 4 steps. make an obvious cue, make it really pretty, make it easy to respond to, add a satisfying reward.
- breaking a bad habit is inverting these 4 steps. remove the cue, make it unattractive, make it difficult to response, remove the reward. 





## The 1st Law

### Chapter 4 notes

- example of heart attack prevention - paramedic was able to spot the signs of heart attack even before it occurred. recognized a pattern of less blood being sent to face.
- brain is a prediction machine always running in the background, it notices what is "important" 
- you don't need to be aware of a "cue" for it to begin the habit. this makes habits dangerous as the actions come from your subconcious.
- cues can be so common they become invisible. 
- gain control of your current habits before building new ones
- example of awareness - pointing and calling out for the japanese rail
- there are no GOOD or BAD habits. just EFFECTIVE ones. 
- if you pursue a habit that conflicts with your DESIRED identity, you're going to have a bad time.
- "does this behavior help me become the person i want to be?"
- speak your "bad" habits out loud to draw awareness to them and make the consequences of such a habit more real
- the process of changing a habit starts with noticing it and being aware of it


#### List of my "daily" habits during a typical workday

- wake up =
- (if SO is nearby) check in on her + 
- check watch/time =
- if there is time, sleep in a bit more - // sleeping in too much could be bad
- otherwise, get out of bed, put on something warm +
- drink some water +
- check personal phone for any urgent messages =  // as long as it's a quick glance at the screen and no actual browsing, we're good. 
- check work phone for anything urgent - // that can wait after i'm at work.
- occasionally get into skimming work emails  - // that can wait until i'm at work
- use the bathroom = 
- sometimes, if nothing urgent, workout here, then shower. + // nothing should stop me from getting in some exercise in the morning.
- brush teeth = // could also make sure to floss here.
- wash face = 
- make coffee = // note that the act of making coffee itself is fine, not the actual side effects of it... currently hyper and mild headache and that feels bad. need to amend this habit so i'm not hurting myself and it becomes a positive.
- make breakfast 
- have coffee while planning out the workday + // should ONLY be planning.
- review personal things to be done that day +
- empty out humidifier and replace water = 
- change clothes into work clothes +
- apply eye drops = // need to do this consistently for now since dry eyes.
- start working until a bit before noon, usually trying to take screen breaks after 20-30 minutes of work = // this can be broken down more

- no more phones or screens after 10 PM +
- brush teeth =
- read a bit +
- put on dental guard, eye mask, nose strips + // sleeping is the formula to success
- lights out before 11 most days +



### Chapter 5 notes

- you need *implementation intention* to get started on a habit - make a plan about when and where to act. how do you plan to implement a habit? being specific helps progress.
- common cues to trigger a habit are time and location. "when situation X happens, i will do response Y"
- people who create a plan for implementation will more likely follow through with it because they have more CLARITY
- **Diderot effect** : obtaining one item may spiral into obtaining more items. This states a common principle - doing one action typically may cascade into more
- **Habit stacking** : Applying the diderot effect by pairing a current habit with a new one you are trying to do. Tie existing behavior with a new one you'd like to do. - You want to have a game plan for which action should come next. Habit stacking implicitly uses the existing time and place for the existing habit to reduce friction.
- Try to chain this off of successful habits to raise your success rate when habit stacking. 
- Habits must be specific. "read more" is not specific. "read one chapter of this book before beginning the workday and as i have my morning coffee" is more specific.


### Chapter 6 notes

- example of adding more water options to cafeteria and making it more accessible
- people choose products based off of where they are, not what they are. examples: selecting a food product because it's on the middle shelf, not the bottom shelf. or eating cookies not because you like them, but because they were "right there" 
- environment shapes your behavior. Lewin: "behavior is a function of a person in their environment"
- customers might buy products simply due to how it was presented to them
- half of the brain's resources are devoted to vision. what you see can really impact what you do.
- example of where the electric meter was impacting usage of electricity - folks who saw the meter every day used less electricity overall
- "out of sight, out of mind" is the key here. if the cue to spark a habit is hidden, it becomes easy to ignore
- make your habit cue a BIG part of your environment. it'll be harder to ignore. and it is much easier to make a better decision if the cue for your habit is in front of you
- be a designer of your own world, not just the consumer of it
- example: being at a bar, you feel like you want to drink. locations develop certain habits and routines.
- look at your environment as relationships, not simply things
- habits are easier to change in a new environment. new place opens your eyes.
- avoid mixing context of one habit with the other. if phone is used for multiple things..can't use it for one task. (i use it just for calls and mail nowadays)
- you need an environment that is stable and predictable. <==

Aside - listened to a podcast on edison. edison was extremely hard of hearing. this seemed to lend a hand to his inventing capabilities as he was able to tone out distractions: https://www.nps.gov/edis/faqs.htm . perhaps there is value in "losing" senses as it'll lend sharpeness in other areas.

Second Aside - I've been living in 2 houses since the start of the pandemic. I don't have a stable environment developed really well in either. That's a lot of work for me! 


### Chapter 7 notes

- example: heroin addicts during wartime stopped being addicted when they were back home, away from a war torn environment. addictions in this case could disappear right away.
- on the other hand, many heroin addicts who went to rehab got better, came back home and relapsed.
- "all that is needed is a bit of discipline" is an incorrect prevalent thought
- what we regard as "disciplined" people typically just put themselves in less tempting positions - don't need to practice self restraint if you are not in a situation to begin with
- once you've encoded a habit, if you don't see the cue, you don't act.
- we want to avoid the runaway train of bad habits - they are autocatalytic and one bad habit will typically lead to another
- external cravings can cause you to repeat a bad habit
- example: cocaine addicts being shown a picture of cocaine so fast that their brains didn't have time to fully process it, but right away, brain activity in the reward pathway.
- you can break a habit but you won't fully forget it.
- **to eliminate a bad habit, reduce exposure to the cue that starts it**
- for breaking a had habit, invert the first law - make it NOT obvious.
