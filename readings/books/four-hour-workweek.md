# Reading on Atomic Habits 


## Progress:
9/19/21: Added what little notes I had taken prior in the name of cleaning up my inbox.


## Notes:
- Being overwhelmed is not productive. 
- Be more selective to be more productive. 
- Focus on the important few, ignore noise.
- Lack of time is lack of proper prioritization.
- Most 9-5 jobs invent the illusion of work... so people invent tasks to fill up that time.
- The best employees have the most leverage.
- Typically, no incentive to use time well unless you are paid on commission rather than salary
- Free yourself from office 9-5 so that you are able to be more effective with remote work. 
- 9-5 is arbitrary, simply a collective social agreement (but to be fair, helps you relate better with your fellow workers) aka “the struggle”
- you DON'T need to spend 8 hours a day to be a millionaire or to live comfortably
- Time will magically expand or contract to fill the allotted hours - Parkinson’s law. The magic of imminent deadline. Time pressure forces you to focus on execution. - Do only the bare essentials
- Without a deadline, you work without focus. With too many deadlines, the word deadline is pointless. So have less deadlines, but make them real clear.
