# How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age


## Notes for first meeting - up to "essentials of engagement"

> We are self-preserving creatures who are instinctively compelled to defend, deflect, and deny all threats to our well-being, not the least of which are threats to our pride.

> Calm yourself before communicating to another. When you are put off, the first five minutes are usually the most volatile.


I resonate with this so much. When I get criticized in the past, I would flare up right away and defend myself without thinking. 
I still feel this. But the difference is I do learn to pause a little and think about the intent. But I am not perfect and I will always need to suppress the urge to defend and lash back. This is a practice that will last a lifetime, and the only way to get better (and grow a tougher skin!).

> “As much as we thirst for approval,” explained endocrinologist Hans Selye, “we dread condemnation.”
> We all have an innate, unquenchable desire to know we are valued, to know we matter.
> We are all united by one single desire: to be valued by another.


We want constant validation and hate being condemned. In a weird way, I try to flip this by seeking condemnation/anticipating that people will hate on it. By starting there, I can only be impressed. Is that a good thing?

> When we attempt to use criticism to win an argument, to make a point, or to incite change, we are taking two steps backward. People can be led to change as horses can be led to water, but deprecation will rarely inspire the results you are aiming for.

> the moment you use a medium to criticize, the subject of your criticism is compelled to defend. And when another is defensive, there is little you can say to break through the barriers he has raised.


I have faced this myself. I can't easily change how people think by being objectively right or wrong to begin with, as individuals may be very emotion driven. By criticizing them, all hopes of appealing to their reasonable/logical side goes out the window as they go into "defense" mode. It's better to befriend, understand, and then share your point of view while echoing their point of view if you want to "win" an argument. Heck, "winning" an argument isn't even the goal. It's coming to an understanding.

> Better still to always follow a simple principle in our dealings with others—don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.
> the one who speaks in a spirit of respectful, unhyperbolic affirmation will always win more friends and influence more people to positive progress than the one who communicates in criticism, condemnation, and condescension.


I made this actually a resolution at the start of 2021! Well, specifically not back-talking people. I am still working on this. I realize that complaining without suggesting a next step shows that I don't care enough to seek change or a brighter tomorrow. Even if my next step is poor, it is a first step mentally. But criticizing and condemning others gets nowhere - the problem remains unsolved, and now you've lost the people who might be able to turn around the situation...
I think I used to talk a lot of smack when I was younger. And I wonder why I didn't retain many friends going into higher schooling... 

> it is neither wise nor necessary to criticize others to make your messages more effective, more important, or more newsworthy.

So if the core of your argument rests on making another individual look bad, likely it's a shaky argument to begin with...



> The people most widely respected within industries, companies, families, and groups of friends are those who are clear in their own viewpoints while remaining compassionate with those whose minds or behavior they would like to influence.


I don't know about this, but I can workshop this. There are some individuals with high net worth who are, by today's standards, successful. But to say that they are also respected? Back in my old company, I respected a particular individual who was very articulate, very stubborn but clear on why X/Y/Z was bad - and everyone respected him for that. While he may have been wrong, he  admitted when he was wrong. He was certainly passionate when arguing, but knew when to stop and still threw in his full support of whatever it was (even if he didn't agree with it). And he was always consistent on certain topics. I strive to be more like him every day. I don't raise conflicts much or have clear viewpoints on many things - I tend to act more like a chameleon and blend in with whatever group I am in.

> The simplest way is to focus on improving yourself instead of others.

... yes.


> Competition is healthy and should be respected. Collaboration is critical and should be protected.
> showing adversaries that you regard them with admiration can resolve even violent conflicts.”


This really hit me. We _want_ competition. Lack of competition inhibits growth. It's definitely weird to say that we want conflict. We want healthy conflict - in an ideal world, where rules are followed, where the conflict causes folks on all sides to innovate in search of greater heights. 
You want respect, not outright primal fear.
And you can agree to disagree on certain matters while remaining on good terms. We can't agree on everything, after all.


> the recipients of every bit and byte of your communication want value.

> to influence others to act, you must first connect to a core desire within them.

> Influence requires more intuition than intellect. To do so takes a shrewd and spontaneous ability to read beneath the surface of an interaction.

>  It is a matter of discerning what they truly want and offering it to them in a mutually beneficial package.
> arouse in the other person an eager want.



This will help me with my sales pitches for sure! They don't want to hear about my product and how I want to meet my numbers/goals. They want to hear about how I'm addressing their problem. Their hurt. Their need. And how I can provide value. The product is merely a tool that will drive value. I'm not smarter than the customer, or the person I'm working with. I know a certain piece of knowledge which I want to impart (with passion!) and if they aren't receptive, no manner of reasoning or numbers is going to sway them. What's in it for them? Why do they even care? 


> the greatest influencers are those who held their tongue and swallowed their pride
> gaining influence is about setting yourself apart, stepping to a higher plane in the mind and heart of another.


I hold my tongue a lot more these days. I still have to swallow my pride better. I don't think I aim to be a great influencer, but I do want to have impact when I speak. To that end, this is something I continue to work on. Thinking for the future as well as the now. Always looking at myself from the lens of another person. 


> If I am the problem with the world, and you are too, then we can stop worrying about who is right and get on with the work of making our world better.
> All great progress and problem solving with others begins when at least one party is willing to place what is already good on the table.


This! I don't care who is right in the end (ok, I lied. I do. But I don't bring it up) But the problem needs to be solved, and .. are you with me? We can fight and reason all day about who caused the problem, but the problem needs to be plugged.
I've always been one to put down the sword (or better yet, not even draw the blade) in times of conflict.

> when we treat him as if he already were what he potentially could be, we make him what he should be.”

We raise people up, not put them down. I do this a lot more these days with everyone. I do my best see them in all things good/bad, but focus on what I can do to grow the individual with all of my might.


> the person who speaks in a spirit of dialogue and altruistic discovery nabs a significant advantage.

Here's my main value I think as a "solutions" oriented person. I'm not really selling, I'm trying to fix. I'm the plumber. I don't care about numbers, I don't care about goals. But I am equipped with a set of tools and I want to to help you. How can I help you? I know you have certain problems, tell me more about them.
