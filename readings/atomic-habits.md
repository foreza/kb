# Reading on Atomic Habits 


## Discussion Points:

- If 1% improvement is all that it takes to achieve success, why don't more people do it? (chapter 1)
- What are some 1% errors we have in our lives today that we could stop? (chapter 1)
- Can we attribute most successes in general to good habit setting? (chapter 1)
- Quite frankly, most of us are afraid of serious health issues. Negative compunding can directly lead to bad health issues. Can we use this knowledge to reframe how we approach our day to day so that it doesn't get to that?
- Have we ever had any "breakthrough" moments in the last few years? How did that feel? (my personal example - skateboarding)
- 

## Progress:

9/5/21: I kicked off the whole "kb" idea to keep myself honest. A little change every day to get myself working. Initial commit. 


## Chapter 1 notes:



### Habits also compound, like interest. 
1% improvement every day will compound (cycling team example, improving in unexpected areas).
Not all improvements are noticeable right away. Small improvements have an additive effect. 
Improving bit by bit will be noticeable over a longer period of time. 
It may take a long time before you recognize/realize the impact of your actions.

Example: 
Being generally frugal will not help day to day, or right away.
But over time, you will have saved more than a millionare who spends much more per day.

Our bad (small) choices will compound into toxic results if left unchecked - catch ourselves from repeating 1% errors
Impact of setting/changing habits can lead to very drastic changes.

### Success is the byproduct of daily habits. 
Be more concerned with your trajectory than the results.
Think about the "lagging measure". You are what you repeat (eat!).
Goals don't matter as much as the way you get there.
Habits are double edged sword - make them work for you.


### Positive compounding
- one extra task a day = a lot done over a year!
- getting more knowledge a day, learning small things... commitment to lifelong learning.
- relationships compound. being excellent (consistently) to others results in them investing in you

### Negative compounding
- stress compounding. Add high blood pressure, job stress, parenting = health issues!
- negative thoughts also compound. If you think your peers are stupid, everyone will be stupid eventually to you.
- riots/protests are not created in a day, but rather just a byproduct of microaggressions and and aggravations.

### Breakthrough Moments
Ice cube melting analogy for describing progress.
Room is getting warmer, ice cube stays as is until 32 degrees. 
This is an example of a "breakthrough" moment. 

Other examples of "breakthrough" 
cancer (spends 80% of life seemingly undetectable)
bamboo (doesn't sprout for a long long time but will then shoot up overnight)
earthquakes (2 tectonic plates grinding for a looong time)


### To get to a breakthrough, you must cross the "valley of disappointment".
This is why most efforts to set habits fail - no easy return in investment, person gives up.

You need to persist long enough to break through this plateau. (plateau of latent potential)

### You don't necessarily waste work, it was being stored for later.
^ I can actually resonate with this one. I spent the first few months of my new job literally contributing nothing.
I was supposed to help out on issues, but couldn't do much since I knew nothing of the industry or the product.
I made bad decisions, had fairly little output, and was constantly kicking myself for not being better.
And yet 6 months later, I was able to begin contributing in a more useful fashion. 
What did help was that it was a job, not some hobby - I didn't really have an option beyond a) quitting and finding another job or b) sticking through with it and doing what I could.

Takeaway quote summarized in my own words:

When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering at a rock.
No visible damage shows as they hammer away. But at the 100 or 101 hit, the rock finally cracks breaks.
Did the stonecutter hit harder than before? No. It was the combined efforts of the hits before it that weakened it enough. 


### Breaking a bad habit is tough, builidng a good habit is like caring for a delicate flower daily. Focus on systems.
Specific actionable goals are fine, but it's the journey that really matters.
Goal - specific goal to achieve.
System - the method of achieving the goal. 

Examples:
Football Coach's goal is to win. System is to recruit the best players that follow a specific standard, hold daily practices, get good assistants and analysts.
Startup CEO's goal is to get brought out. System is to network extensively and every day, tackle features to increase valuation, hire developers who are familiar with scalable systems.
Musician's goal is to play new piece. System might be to practice every day for an hour, see an instructor, replay difficult measures, try different tempos.

### You could succeed in your goal if all you focused on was your system.

Relevant example to me  - my initial goal was to do the very best I could do in the partnership with a specific partner.
The relationship had soured by the time I joined, so I set a lofty goal of being recognized by this partner as an outstanding individual that might even get hired by them one day.
My system needs lots of tweaking, but I focused only on it and literally forgot about the goal.
I was always candid with the partner, went up to bat for them constantly, and fought internally to get more visibility on their projects.
I took extra time out of my day to speak with the partner's devs, made them feel comfortable, and addressed concerns as soon as they came up.
I also took on additional responsability and rose to be a SME and even an engineer on the platform, rather than just the technical solutions guy passing the message or buck.
I got there, alright. I didn't even know I had gotten there till my last few days with the company.
I had been completely ingrained in my own process.

If I had only focused on being recognized by this partner, I might have instead done other things that may have come across as a play for attention, or not being productive.
I might have gotten impatient earlier on and just asked earlier on to be transitioned off the project.
But since my system was to always be consistent, do my best, and be inquisitive - it paid off.

### Winners have the same goals as losers

Wow, this hurt. But it's true. If there is a gold medal and 5 people competing ... somebody is going to lose, no doubt about it.
If we focus on the goal alone, we're going to be in for a bad time.
But these 5 people are also at the absolute top of their sport and they didn't get to where they were by simply dreaming - they had to train. Relentlessly.

### Achieving the goal is momentary.

Messy room cleaned? Great! It'll get messy again by next week.
But if you are constantly cleaning as you go...
Don't treat the symptom. Root out the core root cause. 
Fix the input of the function and the output might be better / you don't have to do as much work. 

### Focusing just on goals will make you mostly miserable

OW this hurt hard. But this is also true.
If your goal is "attain a A+ at the end of the semester", boy it's going to suck.
But if you focused instead on studying well for 3 hours every day in the morning, taking notes, and getting a full 8 hours of sleep - you'll probably feel better if you could hit those smaller milestones.
And likely get the A as well since you're focusing not on the goal, but the process of getting to that goal.

I'm wrapping up for this session, but I want to workshop myself.
I want to finish this book, for instance.
Well, why don't I try just reading for an hour each day, and notetaking just like I do now?
It's not long, and it's not boring. I'm really into it, and this way generates lots of content.
And I can push my github commit streaks.
What's bad about that?
