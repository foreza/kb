2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


Dumb answer:

Multiply all the numbers from 11-20 (as 1-10 all divide evenly into them)

Got a ridiculously large number which was not the solution.


Slightly smarter answer:

Break all the numbers down into base components.

The numbers that can't be simplified:

11, 13, 17, 19 = 46189

From there, we take our remaining numbers and figure out how we can reduce them.

12: 2,2,3
14: 2,7
15: 3,5
16: 2,2,2,2
18: 2,3,3
20: 2,2,5

We'll need to keep at most:

2 (4) - 16 has to be supported. We can drop all other 2.
3 (2) - 18 has to be supported. We can drop all other 3
5 (1) - Supports both 20 and 15 by being included
7 (1) - supports 14

After that, you just multiple this all together:

46189*2*2*2*2*3*3*5*7 = 232792560
