# pork knuckle

I'm attempting to make the crispy pork knuckle for my group of friends this year.
Schweinshaxe.

## Ingredients/Tools:

There shall be 2 components:
- the knuckle itself
- gravy

### Tools:
- toothpicks/sharp knife - pierce skin, pierce the heavens.. purchased
- metal skewers (hold the skin down. can feasibly be used to hold your hair back as well, would not recommend however...) - purchased
- oven that is capable of going up to 500 (ROAAAST) - should have
- roasting pan (for holding the gravy) - the pork hock will sit on top - have
- wire rack (pork hock's seat) - purchased
- Spice grinder (ideally a mortar/pestle) or a nutri-bullet [nice to have]
- meat therm (so you don't overcook your poor thing)
- aluminum foil (to cover your poor thing's bone and tender butt, as well as stabilize it upright)
- ?? heat gun? -

### Knuckle:
- pork hock(s) - I got these from weee, but ideally you'd want to visit a butcher
- White vinegar (this gets brushed onto the top to either reduce the "pork" odor, or help with crackling?)
- Garlic Cloves (this gets stuffed into small little sections of the hock)
- Juniper berries (whole foods, look for morton and basset)
- Caraway seeds (whole foods)
- Fennel (whole foods)
- Olive Oil

### Gravy:
- Dark Beer (perferably any dark ale, porter or stout) - I'll go to Bevmo and try to find Weihenstephaner Tradition Bayrisch Dunkel
- Carrots
- Onion
- Garlic
- Chicken Stock
- Corn Starch
- Bay leaves
- Salt
- Sugar

> The beer seems to add the main flavor, as well as most of the color. The rest are used to round it out/typical ingredients of a stock. Salt and sugar to taste. Chicken stock is optional and could be omitted. The drippings from the knuckle will drop into the gravy.



## Steps:

### Section 1 - Preparation

1. Poke the pork hock skin with toothpick / sharp knife.
  - WARNING: do NOT penetrate the skin layer completely to the meat. If you do that, meat juice explosion later on. No crispy skin. Sad.
  - More bubbles the merrier. No prick = hard skin = broken teeth.
2. Brush ALL of inside MEAT with the  vinegar to get rid of the "pork" odor
  - not the skin. just the meat for now. (oops, first time i put it on the skin too)
  - make sure to get the meat under the skin as well.
3. Use a small knife and make small little cuts in the meat itself - stuff small pieces of garlic in for flavor.
  - this flavors the meat.
  - i wonder if it makes sense to roast the garlic first...?
  - this was a hard step to do.
4. Take the spices (juniper berry, fennel, caraway) and grind them up in whatever way you prefer
  - Ideally use a mortar and pestle, but I don't have one.
5. Oil the meat with olive oil. Rub it everywhere. 
  - Make it an oil spill. (kidding)
6. Take the spice mix and RUB it all over the meat. Skin, meat, everywhere. 
  - It's a sin if you try to cook it without spices, guys.
7. Pull the skin all the way down - you want that stuff TIGHT. Use the (metal) skewers to hold the skin in place, form an X shape. 
  - Both Spice'n pans and recipetineats have better explanations on how to do this.
  - no metal skewers - could use wood, but make sure to soak them through for an hour before use.
  - Don't skewer too far down - meat and/or skin might rip it out.
8. Dry it out overnight, or even 2 nights (like what Amanda Tastes did). The dryer, the better the results will be. 
  - Leave it sitting upright on a plate to catch the morning sun (hah)
  - Do not cover it. If you have a roommate, I'd advise letting them know of your shennanigans before hand...

### Section 2 - meat showtime

0. preheat oven to 350 F (sorry, celsius fans)
1. get all the gravy ingredients together first, combined/chopped and chilling in the roasting pan.
  - bit of a late note, but make sure the roasting pan has enough depth.
2. Arrange the pork hock directly over the roasting pan on the wire rack. The cut side should be pointing down. 
  - use the aluminum foil to prop it up 
  - yes, the skewers stay in. if you are using wooden skewers, trim them so they don't catch fire later.
  - this way, the inside of the hock stays nice and moist and we collect the meat juices.
3. Put the whole howls moving castle inside your oven. Roast till the internal temp of the thickest part of the hock is 185 F.
  - dear god i hope you do measure this before hand
  - the skin after this step should be soft, rubbery, DRY, but not CRISPY
  - if it's crispy already, you done effed up. you may as well just eat it now. :upside_down_smiley:
4. Now for the fun part.. crank your oven to "volcano mode" (500 F) 
  - yes, i googled. it looks like this is the upper limit of most home ovens. you should be OK. if however you touch your oven with your bare hands, you will not be OK. be safe 
5. Put the vinegar (~1 tablespoon?) on the skin of the hock now. And then put the hock back in the oven once it's up to temp (switch to a different tray)
  - don't put the drippings back in obviously.
6. Let the hock cook for about half an hour, rotate as needed halfway through and use vinegar.
7. Take it out, and let it rest for at least 15 minutes. Go to gravy.

### Section 3 - Gravy

1. From section 2 step 3, you should have the starting point for gravy after the hock comes out. Strain the contents (which should also have pork hock juices) into a pan.
2. Bring it up to temp and get the ~taste right
  - Too little liquid? Add water.
  - Too much liquid, cook it out a bit.
3. Thicken the sauce with cornstarch.
  - don't add it directly ya doofus. mix with cold water to form a slurry, then put that in.
  - we're expecting a thin syrup. not too thick.
4. Pour on the hock, or serve with the hock!
