# Pork Knuckle - Jason's hybrid version

I'm attempting to make the crispy pork knuckle for my group of friends this year. Schweinshaxe. We have the knuckle itself + sauce


## Ingredients/Tools:


### Tools:
- toothpicks/sharp knife - pierce skin, pierce the heavens.. purchased
- oven that is capable of going up to 500 (ROAAAST) - should have
- roasting pan (for holding the hock)
- Spice grinder (ideally a mortar/pestle) or a nutri-bullet [nice to have]
- meat therm (so you don't overcook your poor thing)
- aluminum foil (to cover your poor thing's bone and tender butt, as well as stabilize it upright)
- heat gun (or oven with broiler)
- baking soda

### Ingredients:

#### Main Meat stuff
- pork hock(s) - I got these from weee, but ideally you'd want to visit a asian market or butcher (zion has these as well)
- beer (lager, like taiwanese beer works)
- green onion
- large pot

#### Brine Liquid
- star anise (2-3)
- salt (generous amount)
- pepper (?? up to you)
- sugar (?? rock sugar preferred but up to you)
- light soysauce (or dark, not sure)
- bay leaf (2 per hock)
- filtered water (enough)
- large container (can use a bag!) for brining
- vinegar (black)

#### Sauce:
- dark soy sauce
- sesame oil
- ginger 
- garlic
- honey

## Steps:

### Section 1 - Preparation/Brine

1. Assemble the brine liquid and put the hocks in there for 2-3 days. 
  - Ensure either the hock is fully covered and/or move it to ensure the meat is fully saturated. 
  - This step is to ensure the meat remains most when we dry it out.
2. Put the brine liquid, hocks, and a can of beer along with the onions into a pot, and cook until the meat is about to fall off the bone (internal temp of meat should be 150+ at least)
3. Remove meat from liquid, let cool for a bit
4. Use tooth picks and stab the surface all over. Don't go too deep.
5. Rub baking soda all over. This helps with drying.
6. Put the hock(s) uncovered in the fridge to dry out for 2-3 days.

### Section 2 - meat showtime

1. preheat oven to 465 F 
2. use foil to cover the bone/meat on the hocks, only skin should be showing.
3. Put hock in oven and cook for 40-50 min.
4. Now for the fun part.. crank your oven to "volcano mode" (500 F) 
  - yes, i googled. it looks like this is the upper limit of most home ovens. you should be OK. if however you touch your oven with your bare hands, you will not be OK. be safe 
  - or, take out the hock and use a heatgun to crisp up the skin.
5. Let it rest for at least 15 minutes. Make dippin sauce

### Section 3 - Sauces

1. Mash (or mince) garlic, ginger
2. Mix with sesame oil, soy sauce, honey.
3. Add more stuff as desired (chilis for heat, whatevs)
4. Serve with the hock!
