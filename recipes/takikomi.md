# Takikomi - Jason's take
​
## Ingredients

- 1 cup strong dashi
- soy sauce (X tablespoons)
- mirin (or 1 tbs sugar, 2 tbs sake) // figuring this out
- 1 cup rice
- Mushrooms (4 or 5)
- 1 carrot sliced
- 1/2 cup sliced bamboo (or any seasonal vegetable)
- chicken (preferably leg meat) // figuring out how much
- 2 tablespoons sake
- Salt (to taste)
​

## Directions

- Prepare your dashi and set aside
- Wash the rice and set aside - this hydrates the rice (improves the texture and flavor)
- Chop vegetables, set aside (leave as bite sized pieces)
- Slice the chicken into bite sized pieces, add the soy sauce, mirin, and sake to marinate.
- combine them either in a rice cooker or a deep sauce pan + marinade. RICE first, do not mix the ingredients, dashi last.
- cook rice as you normally would.
- remember to wash your rice cooker afterwards.
