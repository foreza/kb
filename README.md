## Premise:
I'm trying to create a space to clean up my mind and my life.


Here is a lively documentation of what I'm trying to do.


I'll put most things into the archive to know what worked and what did work.


Most recently, I've:
- Wiped out the readings, daily gratitudes, and recipes. It was taking a lot of time, and wasn't really helping.
- Introduced a new section for "index of discards" to help me get index and get rid of old things still hanging around.
- Trying to use this to keep track of my euler code solutions. I wager this will move soon.
- The thoughts file is great. I might have to create more.
- And hmm, those resolutions are still empty...
