Keeping myself accountable.
Tackling reading, documenting my daily gratitude, and positive experiences.
Also, recipes that I have to fine tune over time since the pandemic has forced my hand. 

## readings

I want to document and summarize all of my readings here as I read anything.

I seek to read more. Why?
- To broaden my perspective so that I see beyond my day to day.
- To challenge how I think and learn.
- To remind myself that there is always something I don't know.
- To walk many more miles in the shoes of others.

I typically read things about self-improvement, engineering practices.

My long time weakness has been reading but not really reading.

I've found that the only way to really begin to read for me is to summarize in my own words. And be corrected, and try again.

## daily gratitude

I want to list 3 things that made me happy that I'm grateful for, every day.

I seek to be more grateful. Why?
- Putting myself in a positive mindset helps me tackle larger challenges.
- Seeing the good in life primes me to see opportunities.

I usually try this for a day or so and then forget.

I'm using a technique called "habit stacking" with my daily coffee so that I can build this out.

Goal here is to "tetris stack" myself so I see good things everywhere.



## positive experience

I want to aim to document 3 positive experiences every week.

I seek to document more positive experiences. Why?
- Positive experiences should be called out explicitly so that they stand out.
- We need a ratio of 3:1 - 3 good experiences to every negative experience
- Good for practicing writing/documentation in general
- Good for spotting common trends in what I consider a positive experience
