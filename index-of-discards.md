# Discards

## Premise 

- This is an area for me to store memories as a processing exercise, sorted roughly by year block.
- This allows me to fully discard physical belongings/digital files and leave the experience behind as a single bullet point in the cloud.
- This will likely mean nothing to the vast majority of people, which is the whole intent of this exercise. :)



## 2020-2022

- Yarn, CCNA. A ghost from protect. If you want to do a venture, just know the cost. Agh, my eyes!
- NYU, USC, UCSD, NW. Then Harvard, Yale, Brown. Applications last second, uploading a bad file. Who would have known the real battle to come was around the corner?

## 2016-2019

- Walk of fame, HK. Early morning to finally end a journey of the first time. Clearing my head. I got what I came for, yet everything was still the same. Was it what you expected?
- Leather jacket in ridiculous heat, a lonely boat ride. A lesson learned. Good egg sandwich, though!
- Old vines, huntington, somi. The 2nd attempt still resulted in a rejection. It was a great example of how everything could go well, and the outcome is still not in your control! Move onward.
- 167 pong. Dabbling in web development helped out in classes. Keep dabbling. 
- Ocgen, Plcmatic, tlv-db You like building tools to make your life easier.  Keeping building.
- Summer Wars for the second time, blue streak, hack organizing. As we learned.. work on yourself first. 
- Neybor, Anchor, Notary. It brought me anguish, and also friends. Take care of yourself and others first. Business always continues without you.
- Subtle Asian Traits gave me opportunity and gave me light.
- I tried to make a little app about fire. That was cute.

## 2012-2016

- Project Dire, OK, CB. I tried to gamify that so hard.
- PMP studying. Job researching back in the day...


## ??-2012

- Being introduced to the world of KPOP, helping out with a box in a door. Sitting at the table alone instead of the dance floor. Maybe I was the flower pot all along! Hah.
