# 3 things I'm grateful for - December 2021

* reminder to commit right after! 

## 12/08/21
I'm sad that I keep missing 3 days in a row. At least I'm catching up.

- Finally got around to submitting that repair request for the sink. It'll be taken care of today.
- SO is stable and was in a good mood. We had a hotpot yesterday and watched a show about mushrooms.
- Very uneventful drive back this morning while I thought about work stuff.

## 12/07/21
I drove up super early in the AM.

- (initially a good thing later turned a bit sour) SO had some friends from out of state over, and they got along well. 
- Had a bit too much coffee the day before and was overdosed all day, it was nice to only have residual headaches the day after. 
- Got hit with a large task from the big boss, which concerned my current boss (who knew big boss from previous company). Lots to learn, little time.

Guess who forgot to do this again for 3 days. This guy!

- Never been to the citadel _outlets_ before. In my youth, I wrote a fanfiction about a mythical assassin stronghold ... ...
- Had a nice lunch with Dad since he wanted to scratch the korean food itch. He found the banchan excellent (his soup arrived late, so we went through 2 helpings) - note to self, he loves the radish..
- Had a very interesting experience recommending energy/breakfast bars to Mom over video chat to fill up the suitcase.

Maintaining this even when life is tough is the real win.

- Great day with dad as the "uber" driver. Got to get some impromptu golf lessons. He did love the driving range!
- I got stuffed with a large hotel breakfast yesterday. 
- I'm staying with my decision to keep my nose out of my SO's business and let her drive her current situation with her friend as she sees fit. It's the right thing to do.

Agh. Rolled out of bed, straight to driving. Forgot this entry.
- Excellent izakaya dinner. Dad and my SO got along quite well.
- SO trying to dress up to impress brought a tear to my eye. She tries so much and I love it
- Mom also dressing up to impress (i didn't even ask!) also impressed. Ah.

## 12/03/21
2 very important parts of life are about to meet.

- Wonderful soon tofu yesterday for dinner. Craving satisfied.
- Switched to a new manager (knew it was coming) and he insisted on understand everything that I wanted, work style, etc. Off to a good start.
- I was able to sleep in today, just "because". Glad that I don't have a schedule which would kill me because I oversleep. (yet)


## 12/02/21
"cut from a different cloth / cut from the same cloth" - why is this in my brain, why?

- Getting complimented by former boss and new boss is simultaneously great and also awkward. I'll take it.
- Day after the first round submissions feels orgasmic.

## 12/01/21
Deadlines.

- Chipotle tacos are nice, and the wait for them could have been... nicer?
- I prepped decently for submitting 4-5 apps with my SO. (the 5th one is a partial one with an extension)
-
