## 10/7/21

I could get used to this early morning thing. Really.

- Went for a nice early morning run (after my 7 AM call). Realized that coffee before run is a bad idea. Will not repeat that experience.
- Got introduced to the group as a whole today at work during our standup. Nice feels. Also, yay for travel.
- Called with my dearest SO in the morning, who somehow slept even less than the day before. Nuts. :o

Looking forwards to... trip in Hawaii. Plane tickets booked, car rental booked.

A bit scattered this morning as I try to pull my habits together!
I have 4-5 of them in training at the moment.

- Got some plain yogurt and plain cereal for breakfast. I enjoyed it, surprised.
- The elliptical posed a decent challenge to my coordination. Much harder than treadmill. Possibly lighter on my knees, too?
- Got my new WF card stuff done. All said and done, was a bit miffed that it wasn't harder. I expected to have to manually change payments everywhere - found out that I had set up direct deposit from my checking... (awkward!)

## 10/5/21
Had a little case of the achies yesterday for not taking care of my eyes and resting.

- Finally got rid of my old trash bin. That thing has been chilling out there for a looooong time. 
- Helped my SO a bit with her concert's preparation (she needed a intro). I don't know actually if I helped, but I lay there and listened.
- Had a pretty good run this morning. I didn't know that it was possible to have 180 heartrate, but then again, this fitbit is a little wonky.

A daily reminder to be present and do one thing at a time.
I was following the flow today... but let the water run too much!

- Found an interesting little contraption which shows an image when light is beamed into it. I'll use this eh... B-U4D to help with my focus when I'm a little worried.
- Put away some other stuff I don't need or use into my "donation" box this AM. Small steps make big progress.
- No meetings today! I'm going to spend some time this AM planning. My internet is fading in and out today as well, so....


## 10/3/21
It's hot. Hoooot. Heat wave.

- Had a nice morning catchup + coffee with a friend, with an awkward fail hug to boot.
- Somehow managed to eat a whole head of spinach since I was low on the greens for today. I'm hungry now, though.
- Compressed 2 of my big boxes into 1 box. It's still full, but I'm working on it...


## 10/2/21
Sudden trip, so I had to write this elsewhere..

- Had the most delicious apple pie. It was cold, but still... wow.
- Started reading “taking the war out of our words”. Definitely spotting a lot of avoidance and passiveness patterns that I’m employing.
- The meat yesterday was deliiiishhh. The small little fat cap of meat took the cake. Blackened, wonderfully fatty, like butter. I must be sweating salt out of my pores.

Let's kick this month off by committing this file a day early, ok?

- Donated 2 large bags of clothes that were basically never worn. I want to make this a friday thing.
- Going to have meat sweats tonight. We're having brazilian BBQ!
- Caught up with mom (and dad!) yesterday. After acting like an entitled teenager (and most certainly feeling like one now), I had a lot of apologizing to do. I'm glad they are still around.
