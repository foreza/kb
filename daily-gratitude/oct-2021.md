# 3 things I'm grateful for - October 2021

## 10/1/21

Let's kick this month off by committing this file a day early, ok?

- Donated 2 large bags of clothes that were basically never worn. I want to make this a friday thing.
- Going to have meat sweats tonight. We're having brazilian BBQ!
- Caught up with mom (and dad!) yesterday. After acting like an entitled teenager (and most certainly feeling like one now), I had a lot of apologizing to do. I'm glad they are still around.
