# 3 things I'm grateful for - October 2021

## 10/3/21
It's hot. Hoooot. Heat wave.

- Had a nice morning catchup + coffee with a friend, with an awkward fail hug to boot.
- Somehow managed to eat a whole head of spinach since I was low on the greens for today. I'm hungry now, though.
- Compressed 2 of my big boxes into 1 box. It's still full, but I'm working on it...

Sudden trip, so I had to write this elsewhere..

- Had the most delicious apple pie. It was cold, but still... wow.
- Started reading “taking the war out of our words”. Definitely spotting a lot of avoidance and passiveness patterns that I’m employing.
- The meat yesterday was deliiiishhh. The small little fat cap of meat took the cake. Blackened, wonderfully fatty, like butter. I must be sweating salt out of my pores.

Let's kick this month off by committing this file a day early, ok?

- Donated 2 large bags of clothes that were basically never worn. I want to make this a friday thing.
- Going to have meat sweats tonight. We're having brazilian BBQ!
- Caught up with mom (and dad!) yesterday. After acting like an entitled teenager (and most certainly feeling like one now), I had a lot of apologizing to do. I'm glad they are still around.
