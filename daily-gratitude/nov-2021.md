# 3 things I'm grateful for - November 2021

... reading in the AM is wonderful.

- Not sure if I'm getting better. But I'm still alive!
- I've excited to begin cooking those pork hocks. I plan to try to boil them or steam them.
- I have the whole day (almost) to plan and think about my crawler!

Later in the evening. 

- The new show we're watching during meals is pretty good. Gang good, police bad? Oh no!
- The new pork knuckle is underway. Day 2 of the brine. Will extract out of brine tomorrow afternoon and cook all of my 4 knuckles. I edited the recipe again for the final iteration with the focus being on making the meat tastier while keeping it still moist, while the skin is still crispy. 
- I can vanish a bit when I'm not working (well.. I'm not exactly well!) and still be OK. That's very good.

Next time I'm a bit under the weather, I need to act faster.

I made this document late... if you are watching... I'm sorry. :(

- Those raisin sticks are really, really good. 
- Chilling a banana works wonders for the texture. Almost like... ice cream..
- Don't you just love the feeling of waking up in the morning and everything feels alright and at peace?

I'll only have ibuprofen if I need to... hah.. :weak_muscle_flex:

Agh....

- Had a nice quiet day just reading and recovering. Still sucks though, but we have meds.
- Had a lovely fantuan/rice roll in my morning gallop to get supplies before I inevitably became too weak in the afternoon.
- Lemon and water. A tried and true combo to ease the sadness.
