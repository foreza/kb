# 3 things I'm grateful for - September 2021

## 9/16/21

Back in LA, going through mails, papers, and organizing.

- Made a cup of coffee. (will i ever get sick of this) And it wasn't too strong - it was just perfect. 20g of beans (coava kilenso), 350g of water at the perfect temperature. 

- Waved hi to our building manager and she waved back. It's good that we have her readily available (over email and in person!) - the other building managers I've seen are nonexistent and are seldom available..

- Brough $10 to the coin/bill changer downstairs and it was working. It sometimes chooses to not work (no coins in machine) but it DID!

Final day in Portland, final day of vacation.

- Had a great cup of coffee today. Actually, many great cups of coffee today. And sharing the amount with my SO means I'm not overly caffinated...

- We got to the airport and through airport security with no stress or major worries. Yeah, we got stopped for 3 bags, but it was all in good fun. LAX didnâ€™t stop us from taking out our kindles or my SO's keyboard...

- We had some bomb ass Burmese food (coconut rice!) and Lebanese food (Fried cauliflower) at the food trucks at the asylum. Man, that was good...

I'm reading a book about happiness, so I started this habit.
I aspire to be a person who seeks to see the beauty in the world first rather than flaws.

- I had a cup of good coffee this morning from a coffee roaster I enjoy.

- I woke up today without a big headache! Yay.

- I took a quick walk with music this morning and the weather was cool and nice - quite relaxing and meditative.
