# 3 things I'm grateful for - September 2021

## 9/18/21

That coffee from yesterday made my day a little less happy.
Note to self: people do buy coffee for a reason. It's consistent.
I made it waaay too strong. 

- We still managed to get mango sticky rice yesterday. It was wonderful.

- Listened to a great podcast about Edison and his improvement, not invention, of the lightbulb. Was pretty inspirational to hear. Next, I get to hear about his little beef with Tesla.

- Had a good morning workout! Half an hour of cardio, and another half hour of some basic lifting. I usually end up skipping, so I'm glad I did.

Late morning... also, I made the coffee super strong today on purpose. Regrets.
New grinder on the way though!

- I slept in. It was wonderful. Normally, I wake up at 7/7:30 - today was nice. Just lying in bed, not having to deal with anything. Got out around 9 AM.

- Took a covid test due to our recent trip. Results came back negative! (which is a positive thing)

- We had a happy accident - I finally figured out why my coffee grind was producing uneven grounds. One of the ceramic plates for my burr grinder was cracked. I've been seeing the ground being super inconsistent for almost a half year - great to finally find the reason.

Back in LA, going through mails, papers, and organizing.

- Made a cup of coffee. (will i ever get sick of this) And it wasn't too strong - it was just perfect. 20g of beans (coava kilenso), 350g of water at the perfect temperature. 

- Waved hi to our building manager and she waved back. It's good that we have her readily available (over email and in person!) - the other building managers I've seen are nonexistent and are seldom available..

- Brough $10 to the coin/bill changer downstairs and it was working. It sometimes chooses to not work (no coins in machine) but it DID!

Final day in Portland, final day of vacation.

- Had a great cup of coffee today. Actually, many great cups of coffee today. And sharing the amount with my SO means I'm not overly caffinated...

- We got to the airport and through airport security with no stress or major worries. Yeah, we got stopped for 3 bags, but it was all in good fun. LAX didnâ€™t stop us from taking out our kindles or my SO's keyboard...

- We had some bomb ass Burmese food (coconut rice!) and Lebanese food (Fried cauliflower) at the food trucks at the asylum. Man, that was good...

I'm reading a book about happiness, so I started this habit.
I aspire to be a person who seeks to see the beauty in the world first rather than flaws.

- I had a cup of good coffee this morning from a coffee roaster I enjoy.

- I woke up today without a big headache! Yay.

- I took a quick walk with music this morning and the weather was cool and nice - quite relaxing and meditative.
