This is a collection of stuff that resonated with me or hit me right in the feels.

> "I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs." (Frederick Douglass)

Sometimes, you just need to take one step. Can't hope forever! 

> ""You only need to know the direction, not the destination. The direction is enough to make the next choice." (james clear)

This helped me clarify what I needed to do next. I'll have to use this more often. Just start moving. 

> “Money is numbers and numbers never end. If it takes money to be happy, your search for happiness will never end.” (bob marley) 

Ow. Yup. My happiness is luckily not going to go there. As long as I'm earning at this amount, I should be good for retirement. But it's easy to fall into this trap....

> "You always know when you’re doing something for the first time, and you almost never know when you’re doing something for the last time." (david at raptitude, william irvine)

Treat every engagement like it were your last - you actually don't know for certain, right? Your bi-weekly meeting with someone may as well be your last and you don't even know. Seeing your SO next to you ... don't take a petty argument to bed, just avoid having that petty argument to begin with! Your first time eating at a place might be your last! It brings a whole different perspective, and dare I say... patience.
