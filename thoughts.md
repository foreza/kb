This is a collection of stuff that resonated with me or hit me right in the feels.

> "And the answer needs to go beyond writing things down. A good example is how, to learn to skate, you cannot just rely on reading books about skating." (Pragmatic Engineer)

You need hands on experience dealing with an outage or a disaster or a problem or in general, just learning. You can read about it in theory forever, but you have to put it into practice to really understand and create that pattern. 

How we handle ourselves in a situation is "tacit" knowledge. Explaining exactly how you reacted the way you did is muuuuch harder. 


> "The only certain thing about outages is that they will always happen. Everything else is up to us. How much effort do we put into preventing them, or into mitigating them quickly, or learning from them?" (Pragmatic Engineer)

Amen. Rather than fighting fires daily, spend the bulk of your time preparing and preventing the fires so that when they do happen...

This is real. A lot of incidents are not in fact tech problems - they are communication issues, gaps in understanding, failures of process, human error. 


> "Choose the right field of competition." (James Clear - Atomic Habits)

I'm still finishing up Atomic habits, and this is a biggie. 
To be frank, I'm not tall. Didn't do so well as school.
I liked games because the more time you spent on it, the more you typically could show for it. Dedication to the game meant more cool weapons, armor, and prestige.
I hated clubbing and socializing events in college. I'd always hang out in the corner with the other "people who didn't fit". 
I love organizing and planning. I worry and think about scenarios that might happen, and prep for them. 

I'm not going to easily become a banker on wall street, or an engineer at the big tech firms in silicon valley unless I figure out where to put my stake in the ground. But we have to try!

>  "I'd also do a lot of programming with pencil and paper, until I could get access." (Walter Bright)

This came from an article I was reading. Back then, if you really loved programming, you'd have to line up / queue up to pay for mainframe access. You had to plan ahead on what you wanted to run / calculate. not like today, where we casually open up our IDE, get a coffee while the cursor is blinking, and sit there staring at the various classes/modules in our project while thinking about what's for lunch. I feel that the constraints of the past really helped mold a whole generation of programmers who prep and plan ahead, which has now sort of been lost with how readily available we can run code. Heck, I can open google chrome, go to the console, and I can type in rubbish that doesn't even get interpreted right and pay basically nothing except the price of my curiosity..


> "The strategies that made you successful in the past will, at some point, reach their limit. Don't let your previous choices set your future ceiling. The willingness to try new ideas allows you to keep advancing." (James Clear)

Trello worked for me in the past in the day to day. But gradually, it's more of a tool that helps me organize my thoughts, and I'm still breaking out of that habit of shifting cards around meaninglessly. 

I used to document tons and tons in Jira. I still feel that is somewhat useful, but it needs to lead to some result. Leaving a paper trail is great, and still important, but there needs to be impact and reason to do so. If nobody is going to read that paper trail, you can be more brief. 

I'm cool with prioritizing "ruthlessly", but to the point that we'll never tackle the smaller things... we have to not work on everything that is on fire. There will always be fires. It's better to take a breather, and find root causes.

And on that note - dedicating more time to work made me somewhat successful earlier on. But it's not scalable and I need to work smarter, and take my own personal time very seriously. 


> "The data are clear that humans are really bad at taking the time to do things that are well understood to incontrovertibly reduce the risk of rare but catastrophic events." (Dan Luu)

We take shortcuts almost always. In the pursuit of revenue or whatnot, we'll ignore the proper process. A larger company may act like a startup to get done what is required. This is a warning light for myself, I suppose. 


> "when your model and reality conflict, reality is always right." (Will Larson)

This was more in the context of systems thinking, but I believe it could be applicable to the day to day as well. We have an idea of how things _should_ be. But at the end of the day, we need to also yield to reality. And if the door is open and it's freezing, you're likely going to be cold, not warm. 

Just because your calculations and thought process led you to believe something doesn't mean it's going to actually always play out that way. Don't get too attached to what you've built - in the end, it's a tool to help you. Reality wins in the end, always! (that's not to say we can't dream, but we have to have to come back to earth)



> "The secret to being productive is to work on the right thing—even if it's at a slow pace." (James Clear)

I've been working on the "right" thing for a couple years now. I'm not the best, but I'm better than before. Consistent technical practice, reading, and steady small projects has built up a pretty strong foundation which is already bearing fruit for my first job.



> When people ask me how to help, I tell them to ask people what they need. (Stephanie Land)

The whole article was a whirlwind to read. Once again... I am so lucky to have what I have. The perspective change is something I really need to consider.

> You are replaceable at work. You are not replaceable at home. Home is your real life.

I know this. No matter what my folks at work say, I'll be replaceable. They can always find another mobile tech savvy guy like me, heck. But J the human is harder to replace in the context of a friendship or relationship. 


> I also do a silent day every 1-2 weeks when I don't speak for a day and don't use my phone either. I observed that when I don't speak for a day, I get a lot more clarity in my mind. (some person on linkedin)

I did this once. It was awkward writing everything down on paper or messaging - I suppose I'll have to cut that out too if I repeat this. But it was certainly the experience. I feel that we need to do more listening! 


> "A good teacher does not teach facts, he or she teaches enthusiasm, open-mindedness and values." (Gian-Carlo Rota)

I agree. We have the ideas behind teaching a bit backwards, now. We insist on ensuring all curriculum is standard so that everyone gets the "same" education, and we do standardized testing. But now, we have a generation (of which I am a part) where we may not think to question, we give up right away when things are not in our favor, and we cling to beliefs that we ourselves do not fully understand...

And it's a struggle to unlearn these. We were stuffed with vocab and memorized many things just to pass tests. In the end of the day, I think our teachers were doing what they had to do, but not what they should have done.


> “The question no longer is whether to outsource, but what and how much to outsource.” (Courtney Rogerson)

Pulled this from a work newsletter, but the message is clear. We want to delegate/outsource things that are not our core competencies.
If I'm not good at reminders, let your phone remind you it's time to eat. We're not good at remembering many many things, so write it down / email yourself / put it in the calendar.
If you tap a generalist for an extremely specific use case, don't act surprised if they have to pass it onto somebody else.
Likewise, if you have a mission critical service, you want redundancy and likely multiple (but well managed) points of failure rather than a single point of failure that will result in 100% downtime. If you don't outsource some of this, if it goes down, it goes down HARD.

> "I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs." (Frederick Douglass)

Sometimes, you just need to take one step. Can't hope forever! 

> ""You only need to know the direction, not the destination. The direction is enough to make the next choice." (james clear)

This helped me clarify what I needed to do next. I'll have to use this more often. Just start moving. 

> “Money is numbers and numbers never end. If it takes money to be happy, your search for happiness will never end.” (bob marley) 

Ow. Yup. My happiness is luckily not going to go there. As long as I'm earning at this amount, I should be good for retirement. But it's easy to fall into this trap....

> "You always know when you’re doing something for the first time, and you almost never know when you’re doing something for the last time." (david at raptitude, william irvine)

Treat every engagement like it were your last - you actually don't know for certain, right? Your bi-weekly meeting with someone may as well be your last and you don't even know. Seeing your SO next to you ... don't take a petty argument to bed, just avoid having that petty argument to begin with! Your first time eating at a place might be your last! It brings a whole different perspective, and dare I say... patience.
