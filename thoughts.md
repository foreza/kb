This is a collection of stuff that resonated with me or hit me right in the feels.

> "The secret to being productive is to work on the right thing—even if it's at a slow pace." (James Clear)

I've been working on the "right" thing for a couple years now. I'm not the best, but I'm better than before. Consistent technical practice, reading, and steady small projects has built up a pretty strong foundation which is already bearing fruit for my first job.



> When people ask me how to help, I tell them to ask people what they need. (Stephanie Land)

The whole article was a whirlwind to read. Once again... I am so lucky to have what I have. The perspective change is something I really need to consider.

> You are replaceable at work. You are not replaceable at home. Home is your real life.

I know this. No matter what my folks at work say, I'll be replaceable. They can always find another mobile tech savvy guy like me, heck. But J the human is harder to replace in the context of a friendship or relationship. 


> I also do a silent day every 1-2 weeks when I don't speak for a day and don't use my phone either. I observed that when I don't speak for a day, I get a lot more clarity in my mind. (some person on linkedin)

I did this once. It was awkward writing everything down on paper or messaging - I suppose I'll have to cut that out too if I repeat this. But it was certainly the experience. I feel that we need to do more listening! 


> "A good teacher does not teach facts, he or she teaches enthusiasm, open-mindedness and values." (Gian-Carlo Rota)

I agree. We have the ideas behind teaching a bit backwards, now. We insist on ensuring all curriculum is standard so that everyone gets the "same" education, and we do standardized testing. But now, we have a generation (of which I am a part) where we may not think to question, we give up right away when things are not in our favor, and we cling to beliefs that we ourselves do not fully understand...

And it's a struggle to unlearn these. We were stuffed with vocab and memorized many things just to pass tests. In the end of the day, I think our teachers were doing what they had to do, but not what they should have done.


> “The question no longer is whether to outsource, but what and how much to outsource.” (Courtney Rogerson)

Pulled this from a work newsletter, but the message is clear. We want to delegate/outsource things that are not our core competencies.
If I'm not good at reminders, let your phone remind you it's time to eat. We're not good at remembering many many things, so write it down / email yourself / put it in the calendar.
If you tap a generalist for an extremely specific use case, don't act surprised if they have to pass it onto somebody else.
Likewise, if you have a mission critical service, you want redundency and likely multiple (but well managed) points of failure rather than a single point of failure that will result in 100% downtime. If you don't outsource some of this, if it goes down, it goes down HARD.

> "I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs." (Frederick Douglass)

Sometimes, you just need to take one step. Can't hope forever! 

> ""You only need to know the direction, not the destination. The direction is enough to make the next choice." (james clear)

This helped me clarify what I needed to do next. I'll have to use this more often. Just start moving. 

> “Money is numbers and numbers never end. If it takes money to be happy, your search for happiness will never end.” (bob marley) 

Ow. Yup. My happiness is luckily not going to go there. As long as I'm earning at this amount, I should be good for retirement. But it's easy to fall into this trap....

> "You always know when you’re doing something for the first time, and you almost never know when you’re doing something for the last time." (david at raptitude, william irvine)

Treat every engagement like it were your last - you actually don't know for certain, right? Your bi-weekly meeting with someone may as well be your last and you don't even know. Seeing your SO next to you ... don't take a petty argument to bed, just avoid having that petty argument to begin with! Your first time eating at a place might be your last! It brings a whole different perspective, and dare I say... patience.
