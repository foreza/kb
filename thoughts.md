This is a collection of stuff that resonated with me or hit me right in the feels.

Ow. Yup. My happiness is luckily not going to go there. As long as I'm earning at this amount, I should be good for retirement. But it's easy to fall into this trap....

Treat every engagement like it were your last - you actually don't know for certain, right? Your bi-weekly meeting with someone may as well be your last and you don't even know. Seeing your SO next to you ... don't take a petty argument to bed, just avoid having that petty argument to begin with! Your first time eating at a place might be your last! It brings a whole different perspective, and dare I say... patience.
